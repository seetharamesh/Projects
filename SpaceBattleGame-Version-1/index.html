        <h1>Learn How to Play Space Battle</h1>
          <p>Earth has been attacked by a horde of aliens! You are the captain of the USS Schwarzenegger, on a mission to destroy every last alien ship.</p>
          <p>Battle the aliens as you try to destroy them with your lasers. The aliens' weakness is that they are too logical and attack one at a time: they will wait to see the outcome of a battle before deploying another alien ship.</p>
          <p>Your strength is that you have the initiative and get to attack first. However, you do not have targeting lasers and can only attack the aliens in order. After you have destroyed a ship, you have the option to make a hasty retreat.  If they destroy you, then the game ends.</p>
          <p>Play the game in your chrome console!</p>
          <p>Good Luck!</p>
